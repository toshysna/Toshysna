- 👋 Hi, I’m @toshysna
- 👀 I’m interested in creating web games (this include game designing, UI and UX mostly)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use AI tools at my advantage
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a game called Core to Space which would be a 3D parkour game where you would start in the core of earth and the goal would be to reach space, traveling through many different layers of earth.

- ⚡ Fun fact: My brain: 90% imaginary scenarios, 10% useful stuff. And it works just fine like that.
